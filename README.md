# Omni Atlas

An SSR project based on Sapper / Svelte with no client-side routing and no trace of front-side libraries.

At this stage it's a completely static website building from data stored in WordPress and MongoDB, so I've decided to eliminate any client-side request and instead automatically re-build the project every few hours. I think this approach provides the best experience for both users and search engines.
